# BostonPotholes
Analyzing pothole repair requests through 311 reports

The intent behind this project is to analyze the 311 reports specifically for pothole repair requests. 
This analysis provides an overlook at the city's road conditions, which neighbrhoods are hit the hardest, and how fast repairs are made.

DataSource : data.boston.gov

Step 1 : The data is analyzed and cleaned. Duplicates, nulls and inconsistencies will be removed.
The data will then be stored in a database for analysis.

Some of the questions that I will be answering as part of this project are:

1. Which are the neighborhoods requesting max repairs?
2. What is the median time to close the cases per neighborhood?
3. How are the cases reported?
4. Total open vs closed cases by neighborhood?
5. Total cases in 2024?
6. Comparison of number of cases open until May 2025 with cases open until May 2024.
7.
